# CoreBlow Ansible

Automated hardened CoreBlow host installation.

## Overview

CoreBlow Ansible is part of the CoreBlow public repository family. Hardened host automation for installing and operating CoreBlow on managed servers.

## Scope

- Ansible playbooks, inventories, and host bootstrap defaults.
